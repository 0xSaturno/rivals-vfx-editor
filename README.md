* **Direct Color Editing**:
  * Click on a color to open the color wheel.
  * Edit the hex code directly in the color field for precise adjustments, copy, and paste.
* **Batch Editing**:
  * **Single Color**: Apply a specific color to all selected parameters.
  * **Hue Shift**: Adjust the hue of selected colors with an interactive slider. *Double click the dot to reset the value.*
  * **Color Shuffle**: Apply a user-defined color palette to the selected parameters, assigning a different color to each one sequentially.
