## **üèóÔ∏è Setup Requirements**
0. Get latest UassetGUI exe from [this repo](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases).
1. **Setup** the requirements to make the conversion scripts work by placing `UassetGUI.exe` in the VFX-editor folder.
2. Get latest mappings file for Rivals, move it to the VFX-editor folder, rename it to `"Rivals.usmap"` and set it up inside your UassetGUI. 
> You need to do this even if you already have done it before because of the way UassetGUI works.
3. You should be ready to use the scripts when they will be needed.

## **üåà VFX Editor Usage**

1. **Launch the `Rivals VFX Editor.exe` app**. 
2. **Load your .json files** by dragging them into the import area or by clicking to select them.
3. **Select the parameters** you want to modify using the checkboxes.
4. **Use the global controls** in the left panel to make your desired changes.
5. **Save your files** by clicking the "Save Files" button. A window will appear to ask for your output folder, grant the app access to that path. The modified files will be saved to a new folder named `output` in the same location you chose to save. 
6. **Convert your edited .json files** with the `convert_to_uasset.bat` script, wait for the conversion to complete and the converted files will be ready for paking.

## **üîÑÔ∏è Conversion Scripts Usage**

Check **Setup Requirements** first to be able to use the scripts.
* `convert_to_json.bat` can be used to batch convert .uasset files to .json.
* `convert_to_uasset.bat` can be used to batch convert .json files back to .uasset.
